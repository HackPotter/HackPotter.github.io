title: A few SECTF Pictures
---

I decided it'd be nice to have a few photos from the DEF CON 26 Social Engineering Capture The Flag up on my site, so without any further ado:

![In the Booth!](/images/Stage0.JPG)This is me in the hot seat, ready to go. I don't want to get all sentimental, but it's been a goal/dream/mission of mine to be in that chair for years now, and finally sitting down in the booth was pretty crazy.

![On the Screen!](/images/OnScreen.jpg)On screen right as the calls began.

![On the Stage!](/images/Stage1.JPG)Finally, delivering my on-stage Q&A about my pretexts and research.

That's all there is for this post, I just figured it was time they existed out in the wild. -JP

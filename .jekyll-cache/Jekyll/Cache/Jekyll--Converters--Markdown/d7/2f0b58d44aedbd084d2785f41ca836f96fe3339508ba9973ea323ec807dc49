I"<p>As a longtime member of the Information Assurance Student Group (IASG) at Iowa
State, I’ve made it a goal to solve all of the CTF puzzlers created by the
cabinet for club members to solve <a href="https://www.twitter.com/blurbdust">(shoutout to Nic Losby for making these
puzzlers for the club)</a>. After receiving the blessing of the cabinet
to publish these answers, I wrote up my thought processes and solutions to all of
the puzzlers published throughout the fall of 2018. Be warned: while I did
eventually solve all of the puzzles, I definitely am not an authority on CTFs,
as you’ll doubtless realize when you see my convoluted and inefficient thought
processes. That being said, I had a lot of fun solving these, and <a href="https://iasg.iac.iastate.edu/puzzlers">I definitely
recommend that you try them on your own before reading my solutions.</a> Without any further ado:</p>
